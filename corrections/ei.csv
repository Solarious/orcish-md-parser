"sebzakhad","f.","cow-hunter: a grievous insult","Implies the only game an orc is capable of bringing down is the humies’ farting, lumbering feed beast. Incidentally, this is why you should never offer an orc beef. It is the custom in many clans to show respect via the food you offer your guests; the more difficult your dinner was to catch, the more honor you show. If possible, offer your Orcish guests bear or lion— they will be on their best behavior, as you have shown them great honor. Venison is perfectly acceptable and conveys healthy respect. Even fish is a good choice, as it takes cunning and patience to catch one. But cow? Might as well say “We think you’re stupid and incompetent.” Wars have begun over less.
